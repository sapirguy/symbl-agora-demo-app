## Quick Start

This section shows you how to prepare, build, and run the sample application. 

### Obtain Symbl App ID and Secret and Agora App ID

To use the Agora example application with Symbl, you'll need to:
1. Create an account. You can signup at [platform.symbl.ai/#/signup](https://platform.symbl.ai/#/signup). 
2. Head to the [dashboard](https://platform.symbl.ai/#/home)

### Download git package
1. git clone https://github.com/symblai/symbl-agora-demo-app
2. cd symbl-agora-demo-app
3. Create ".env" file

### Obtain an Agora App ID

To build and run the sample application, get an App ID:
1. Create a developer account at [agora.io](https://dashboard.agora.io/signin/). Once you finish the signup process, you will be redirected to the Dashboard.
2. Navigate in the Dashboard tree on the left to **Projects** > **Project List**.
3. Save the **App ID** from the Dashboard for later use.
4. Generate a temp **Access Token** (valid for 24 hours) from dashboard page with given channel name, save for later use.

### Add your Symbl App Id + Secret and Agora App Id to the  `.env` file
```
REACT_APP_AGORA_APP_ID=<#YOUR Agora.io APP ID#>
REACT_APP_AGORA_LOG=true
SYMBL_API_BASE_PATH="https://api.symbl.ai"
SYMBL_APP_ID=<#Your Symbl.ai App Id>
SYMBL_APP_SECRET=<#Your Symbl.ai App Secret>
```

### Install dependencies and integrate the Agora Video SDK


1. Using the Terminal app, enter the `install` command in your project directory. This command installs libraries that are required to run the sample application.
    ``` bash
    # install dependencies
    npm install
    ```
2. Start the application by entering the `npm start` command. 
   * Symbl Access Token server is started on port 8081
   * Agora application is started on port 3000
3. Your default browser should open and display the sample application.
    **Note:** In some cases, you may need to open a browser and enter `http://localhost:8080` as the URL.
